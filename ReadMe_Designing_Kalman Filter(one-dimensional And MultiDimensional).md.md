## Designing_Kalman Filter(one-dimensional And MultiDimensional).

## Subject Scope :
This Project Repo will cover the basics of designing Kalman filters

## Steps followed in the Design Parts/Steps;
From
Step 1::Choose the State Variables
Step 2: Design State Transition Function
Step 3: Design the Motion Function
Step 4: Design the Measurement Function
Step 5: Design the Measurement Noise Matrix
Step 6: Design the Process Noise Matrix
Step 7: Design Initial Conditions
Step 8: Implement the Filter Code

## Worked Eamples will include;
Tracking A Dog_Using_A_Simple 1D Kalmann Filter Model.(Where we simulate a dog moving from left to right at a constant speed with some random noise added.We refer to a sample RFID tracker that provides a reasonable accurate position for our dog
Tracking a Robot(Similar to tracking a dog, but in 2D)
Tracking a Ball
Subject Application & Scaling :3d Multi Dimension Kalmann Filter Modelling  & for Accident Mitigitation Prevention through AI & ML Flight Contro Systems Design.

## Problems Analysis & Justification : 
Among the numerous applications of Kamann filters,
We will apply our examples with References to Regulation Aircraft Accident & Safety Investigation & Prevention.
The examples we will look at incidents involving Aircraft Accident & Safety Investigation & Prevention
