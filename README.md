# Python_Projects_Designing a one-dimensional Kalman Filter.

Subject Scope :
Tracking A Dog_Using_A_Simple 1D Kalmann Filter Model.

Subject Application & Scaling :3d Multi Dimension Kalmann Filter Modelling  & for Accident Mitigitation Prevention through AI & ML Flight Contro Systems Design.

Problems Analysis & Justification : References to Regulation Aircraft Accident Reference: Accident & Safety Investigation & Prevention.

SOAM Analysis:IATA/EASA/ICAO Accident & Safety Investigation & Prevention Documentation Reference.

Problems  Reference : We refer to a sample RFID tracker that provides a reasonable accurate position for our dog.But since implementing and/or robustly modeling an RFID system is beyond the scope of our simple model.

Parts/Steps
#1.simulation of the dog
moving from left to right at a constant speed with some random noise added.
Subject Application  &Scaling :3d Multi Dimension Kallmann Filter Global Fleet to Accident Prevention through AI & ML Flight Contro Systems Design.
